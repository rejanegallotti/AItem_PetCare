This project implements an interactive AI agent system focused on assisting pet guardians with basic care. Utilizing **Google Gemini** as the language model and the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** for agent orchestration, the system offers preliminary guidance in essential areas of animal well-being.

## ‚ú® Features

The "AI tem PetCare?" system is composed of specialized agents that can help with:

1.  **Primary Health Diagnosis:** Assessment of common symptoms, identification of warning signs, and recommendations on when to seek veterinary care.
2.  **Home Training:** Practical tips and step-by-step guides for teaching basic commands and handling common behaviors, with a focus on positive reinforcement.
3.  **Natural Diet Guidance:** Information on safe and dangerous foods, and general principles for a natural and balanced diet (always with the caveat about the need for a veterinary nutritionist).

## üß† Architecture

The project uses the Google ADK agent architecture, where different agents with specific roles and instructions collaborate (indirectly, in this case, through the main flow) to process user requests. The `google_search` tool is integrated into some agents to allow searching for external information when necessary.

-   `agente_saude` (Health Agent): Specialist in symptoms and veterinary triage.
-   `agente_dieta` (Diet Agent): Consultant on nutrition and food safety.
-   `agente_treinamento` (Training Agent): Focused on positive reinforcement training techniques.
-   `agente_revisor` (Reviewer Agent): Ensures the safety and clarity of the responses generated by other agents.
-   `root_agent`: Entry point for interfaces expecting a root agent.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run the "AI tem PetCare?" system locally, follow the steps below:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rejanegallotti/AItem_PetCare.git](https://github.com/rejanegallotti/AItem_PetCare.git)
    cd AItem_PetCare
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows (Git Bash/CMD):
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or manually:
    # pip install google-genai google-adk python-dotenv
    ```

4.  **Configure your Google Gemini API Key:**
    Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key). Create a file in the project root called `.env` and add your key:
    ```dotenv
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **Do not share this file and add it to your `.gitignore`!**

5.  **Execute the system:**
    ```bash
    python petcare_agents/agent.py
    ```
    The interactive system will start in your terminal.
